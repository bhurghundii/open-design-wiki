# Open Design Wiki

This is a collection of mockups, prototypes and wire mocks for the different components that make up a modern web app. 

The end goal is to be a comprehensive guide to provide insiparation for designers so we can provide great looking apps to delight and wonder.

# How this works 

In different folders are generic components. In each folder is an accompanying screenshot for that component you can browse through. 

# Contributing Guide
All images must be titled as component-toolusedtobuildthedesign-distinguishingkeyword.png 
Do not attempt to explain to the user the intention: just provide the screenshot
